# About TONY

TONY is a Python package for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to mental health contexts.

The package combines two complementary approaches. First, it employs traditional lexicon-based analyses to extract linguistic markers and compute standard metrics that identify patterns in text. Second, it leverages transformer-based analyses using deep learning models to provide advanced predictions on emotions, psychological states, and clinical traits.

This combination allows researchers and practitioners to analyze mental health-related texts using both interpretable methods and state-of-the-art techniques, offering flexibility for research and clinical applications.
